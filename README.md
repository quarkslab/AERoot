![alt text](img/logo.png "AERoot Logo")
**AERoot** is a command line tool that allows you to give the root privileges on-the-fly to any process running on the Android emulator with Google Play flavors AVDs.
> This project is a rewrite from scratch of the **android-emuroot** tool (https://github.com/airbus-seclab/android_emuroot).
> It comes with new features:
> * Recent AVDs support (Android API > 27)
> * Execution time optimization
> * Selection of a process by its PID

# Installation
AERoot leverages GDB via pygdbmi Pyhton module. Make sure you have GDB installed on your system before continuing.

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quarkslab/AERoot.git
```
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
# Quick-start
First of all, you must launch the Android emulator with the gdb qemu option (-qemu -s).
```bash
emulator @Your_AVD -qemu -s
```

Then run **aeroot.py** by choosing the mode among:
* **pid**: give the root privileges to a process selected by its PID.
* **name**: give the root privileges to a process selected by its name.
* **daemon**: give the root privileges to the ADB daemon, so shells created with adb shell will automaticaly have root rigths.

## Usage
```bash
aeroot.py [-h] [--verbose | --quiet] [--device DEVICE] [--host HOST] [--port PORT] {name,pid,daemon} ...
```

## Examples
### *pid* mode example
```bash
aeroot.py pid 1337
```
> Gives the root privileges to the process with pid 1337
### *name* mode example
```bash
aeroot.py name my_process
```
> Gives the root privileges to the process named "my_process"
### *daemon* mode example
```bash
aeroot.py daemon
```
> Gives the root privileges to the ADB daemon

## Additional options
You can find additional options by checking the help of the tool: `aeroot.py -h`
